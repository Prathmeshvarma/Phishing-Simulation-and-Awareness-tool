# Phishing-Simulation-and-Awareness-tool
This is a tool that simulate a phishing attack and educates about how to recognize it.

The tool should send fake phishing emails to users, simulate common 
techniques used by attackers (such as fake login pages), and then provide feedback on how to 
identify phishing attempts.
